## Contribution Guidelines
- **Originality and Attribution:** **Plagiarism is strictly prohibited** within our project. All contributions must be original and properly attributed. Any work suspected of being plagiarized will not be merged. We value integrity and encourage contributors to uphold the highest standards of academic and intellectual honesty.
- **Assigned Issue Policy:** To maintain an organized and collaborative development process, contributors are requested to refrain from working on issues that have not been explicitly assigned to them. This ensures efficient distribution of tasks and minimizes duplicative efforts. If you are interested in addressing a specific issue, please kindly request assignment from the project maintainers.
- **Working on Assigned Issues:** Once an issue has been assigned to you, you are authorized to commence work on it. This policy ensures that contributors are focused on assigned tasks and promotes a fair distribution of workload. Once you have completed the necessary work, you may proceed to create a Pull Request (PR).
- **Branching and Pull Requests:** All Pull Requests (PRs) must be created from separate branches. It is strongly recommended to create a dedicated branch for each issue you are working on. This practice facilitates better tracking of changes and allows for effective collaboration. Once you are confident that your changes are ready for review, submit the PR for consideration.

**NOTE:** Ensure you have tested the application before making a PR, the code should **NOT HAVE ANY ERRORS, WARNINGS, BUGS**, etc... & it should be working.
